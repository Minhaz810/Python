Even though integers are immutable, you're not changing the integer object; you're changing which object is stored in the list at each index.

So data[j] = factor means:

"Replace the element at index j in the list data with a reference to the factor object."

This is modifying the list, not modifying the integers inside it (which you couldnâ€™t do, because integers are immutable).
